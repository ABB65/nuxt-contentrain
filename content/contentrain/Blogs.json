The news follows multiple years of collaboration, both between the two companies and within the City of Sin.\n\nBy the second half of next year, Motional and Lyft aim to be transporting public passengers, who will be able to book rides through the Lyft app, in Motional’s electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis before scaling up to a full commercial launch where Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.\n\nIt’s not surprising to see Motional and Lyft choose Las Vegas as the first city in which to launch a driverless service, but it is a major milestone for the companies as they work towards their shared goal of commercializing autonomous ride-hail. The two have had a relationship with each other  since 2018, when Lyft and Aptiv launched a one-week program in Las Vegas to test a robotaxi service during CES. In November last year, Nevada gave Motional approval to test its autonomous vehicles without a human safety driver, and just two months ago, Motional announced it would expand its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas and triple the size of its testing facility.\n\n\nIn other words, all signs had been pointing to Tuesday’s announcement for some time. Now, the industry will be keeping an eye out for expansion into more cities. Motional had previously targeted 2023 for commercial launch in major U.S. cities, and this summer, it announced plans to expand its presence in California with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads.\n\nMotional isn’t sharing the exact number of vehicles it will launch with Lyft in Las Vegas at this time, and said it would share additional details on the operational design domain, which would stipulate the conditions under which Motional’s AVs could safely operate, closer to launch.\n\n“The beauty of the agreement with Lyft is that it has the potential to scale widely – we could reach millions of Lyft riders,” a spokesperson for Motional told TechCrunch, also noting that the company would share more information about plans to launch in other cities “in the future.”\n\nThe initial phase of non-commercial driverless deployment, which will begin in 2022, will allow the companies to fine-tune their autonomous offering by collecting rider feedback and improving upon user experience ahead of commercial launch"},{"createdAt":1636467688838,"img":"content/contentrain/static/1636467671464_tumblr_oa3vnzYBaN1qbov0co1_500.jpg","alt":"thmblr","tags":["fb5fbc98-77dc-ed1b-0a60-c1dc6c90e27c"],"description":"This is why I want us to stay together and Remain in Europe.","author":"0c622a43-edfc-b76e-f0bb-b2aa13754a77","ID":"9a22cfba-9ae9-11f5-2c54-27c7ca747059","title":"A Bear Grylls Blog","content":"A personal view by Bear Grylls\nI am proud to represent a number of different & very inspiring organisations, but on this issue, I speak from the heart and only for myself.\nI also so respect the right for people to have varying views: that’s a key part of democracy. But the EU Referendum is an issue that really matters & this is why I believe it is important to be open.\nThis referendum has been hard to watch at times but, at heart, this is what I feel: I have travelled all over the world and have noticed, so often, how many of the most vulnerable people look to the UK for character and leadership, as if we are like beacons of good manners and fortitude. Our country’s values and contribution are respected across Europe and beyond; the UK is a trusted friend to so many nations. Those things can get lost in the maze of headlines.\nAt such a time for the UK to retreat, run and cut ourselves loose from Europe, when there are so many challenges on our doorstep, to me just doesn’t feel either courageous or kind. Europe has many flaws, but I also believe the way to help resolve many of those tough issues is from within. History has taught us that together we achieve more. I guess I believe that to help make the future of the world a better place then that future has to be about partnership.\nAs a taxi driver said to me in Paris recently, we really need you, the UK. Don’t desert us when times are tough, stand with us like you always have.\nThat rang true.\nI have never been a good quitter and I am so proud of the UK and our values: tolerance, kindness, respect, courage and resilience.

It’s not an especially beautiful lane way – a concrete footpath, metal gates on one side and some shrubs and bushes on the other side. I must have walked this exact same route a thousand times before.\n\nExcept today it was different.\n\nI couldn’t explain it but it was as if I was seeing this place for the very first time. I saw bees moving frantically amongst the flowers. The colours were so incredibly vivid. Were these same flowers here yesterday? Had someone come in the middle of the night and changed everything? It felt like that. There were so many details I had never seen before. It was disconcerting and in a way, almost frightening. I was usually a very brisk, purposeful walker but now my pace slowed. I looked around. There was so much life. So much movement. I felt an emotion that wasn’t at all familiar to me in those days…. pure joy. I could feel it intensely in my body. I just wanted to bask in all this beauty. I had been asleep, dead and now, finally I was awake.\n\nIt’s not an uncommon experience when someone starts to practice mediation. As we start to slow down and stop living so much in our heads, we can experience a shift in perspective. Sometimes it is more gradual and subtle, but in my case it was quite sudden and dramatic.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, I came to relish my daily walk down this little lane way. I didn’t listen to my iPod anymore. I listened to the birds signing and the wind moving amongst the trees. Every day I came to the start of the lane way expecting something magical.\n\nExcept I was never able to recapture that first moment of pure wonder. Over time walking down the lane way again became a familiar routine. It wasn’t an enchanted place anymore. Gradually, I slipped back into my old way of being. I still enjoyed my walk to work and I still found it nourishing to be outside but the magic was gone – at least for the time being.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nWhat changed?\n\nThe Irish writer and philosopher Iris Murdoch once said, “people from a planet without flowers would think we must be mad with joy the whole time to have such things about us”.\n\nCan you imagine what it would be like? If you were that person from another planet who had never seen a flower before? How do you think you would react? You would almost certainly stop whatever it is that you are doing. You would quite naturally ask yourself the question: “My God! What on Earth is this wonderful thing?!” There is probably a sense of intense curiosity. Maybe you move closer to investigate? All your senses are alert. What does this object look like? What does it smell like? What does it feel like? Maybe you notice all kinds of tiny details which are only evident when your look very closely…delicate and intricate structures, subtle shades of colour, an intoxicating scent?\n\nHow do you think you would feel in this moment?\n\nExcept here on Earth flowers are everywhere. They are common place. We see them all the time. Occasionally we might see a particularly beautiful flower and remark on how pretty it: “Oh, another flower, a yellow one. That’s nice.” It is a fleeting moment. There might be appreciation but there is no real curiosity, no enchantment, no wonder. For most of us, we certainly aren’t driven “mad with joy”!\n\nWe have all probably experienced how something wonderful becomes mundane over time. We slowly start to take it for granted. Little by little, the shine wears off. It’s what happened to me in the weeks and months following my initial experience walking down the lane way. Without knowing it, I stopped seeing the world with fresh eyes.\n\nThis is simply how the human mind is conditioned to work. If something is very familiar and is not a threat, we generally don’t pay much attention to it. Another sunset. Another tree. Another forest. Another river. Another mountain. Whatever. We’ve seen it all before. They all blend into one.\n\nOn the other hand, if something is new or different we are naturally curious and we want to investigate. We stop. We pay attention.\n\nThink how it is to be on holidays in a new city. Everything is a little bit unfamiliar. There is so much of interest. People look different. We might not understand or recognise their unique language and mannerisms. The architecture is unusual. The trees and birds are different. Is this new city that much nicer or more interesting than your own home town? Objectively, probably not. So why is the experience so much more enriching?\n\nIt turns out that the new environment is not the deciding factor at all. The experience is enriching predominantly because of our mindset. We are curious. We are exploring. We are seeing with fresh eyes. There is a sense of wonder. Quite literally the quality of our attention determines our experience. If we could adopt this same “holiday” mindset in our daily life in our home town…if we could see with fresh eyes all the time, then surely every day would be a holiday.\n\nSo what are we to do when the mind is so conditioned to ignore the things in life which are familiar?\n\nHow do we cultivate this sense of wonder and curiosity which is so crucial to a nourishing, enriching experience?\n\nWell, it’s extremely simple albeit it took me a long time to figure it out myself.\n\nThe first step is to realise this natural tendency the mind has to ignore information which it deems to be “non-essential”. Our habitual state is to not pay attention. In order to break this habit one first of all needs to recognise the existence of the habit!\n\nThe second step is to realise that attention is a tool. We control that tool. We always have a choice. At any moment, we can stop and choose to pay attention to something. More importantly, we can also choose “how” we pay attention. We can zoom in or decide to take a broader perspective. We can choose to engage a particular sense. Our eyes are like a camera. Our ears are like a microphone. Our skin and our nervous system allow us to explore our world in incredible detail. Try it right now. See how much control you have over how you experience the world. There is always a choice.\n\nThe third step is a little bit more subtle and looking back I can see that it is the aspect that was missing from my approach when I was walking down the lane way all those years ago, trying in vain to recapture that elusive sense of awe and wonder. We must let go of all expectation. The more I “tried”, the more I approached that lane way with a memory of “how it was” and an expectation of “how it should be”, the further away I moved from the open curious state of mind which invited my initial experience. Only a gentle, open curiosity, a willingness to look again with “fresh eyes” and see things exactly as they are with no filter, no explanation and no comparison can open the door.\n\nEasier said than done? Try it. For a start, when you are out in nature stop putting names and labels on things: “that’s an oak tree, that’s a blackbird singing”. Words sometimes stop us from seeing with fresh eyes. The next time you see a tree, maybe imagine that you are like that person from another planet Iris Murdoch talked about, who is seeing a tree for the very first time. Seek out the mundane, ordinary places and look with fresh eyes: your back garden, your local park, the little lane way you walk down every day on your way to work.\n\nLet go of expectations.\n\nSlow down.\n\nPay attention.\n\nThis isn’t something which is complicated or new. Every single four year old experiences the world with a natural sense of curiosity and wonder. We have just forgotten how.\n\nTry it and see for yourself."}]
